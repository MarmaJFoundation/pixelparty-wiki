If you need a larger canvas you could buy several connected frames to draw a larger frame.

Are you excited? I am excited.. to get started!! ü§£ Jokes aside, let's have some real fun!

# Rules:
Before we can get invited to any party we need to know the rules of the party. I'd hate to show up to a party in the wrong attire, I'd be embarrassed üò´
## The list of Forbidden Arts:
- Sexual
- Racist
- Violent

These arts can lead to a number of disciplinary actions. You wouldn't want to be ***that guy*** would you?

# Login
Guest Star: Wallet Selector ‚≠ê
![Pixel-Login](https://github.com/Dark-St-r/pixelparty-wiki/assets/93423666/c09c28b3-c259-45e4-80fa-eee04b81e621)
The first step to the process is hitting that big fat login button. When you do, you will see our Guest Star show up to the party, Wallet Selector. With it we can choose to login with a pre-existing wallet or create a new one.

## Why Login?
It would allow us to access and use all the present and future features of the Pixelparty game.

Now that we have greeted the Guest Star, let's go:
# Explore
Let's explore what this party has in store for us:

A beautiful assortment of features for us to try out and have some fun.

# Buy a Frame
The party is finally going. Let's get a frame so we can make art!

To buy a frame one simply has to follow these steps:
- Hover over a frame
- Select buy
- Confirm you wish to purchase
- Finally confirm with your wallet of choice.

Above is an example of steps 2 and 3.
